# MERN boilerplate

The boilerplate is designed in a way that it can be deployed on Heroku at any time.

## Database precautions
#### According to the settings of the project, the MongoDB server is not hosted on  'MongoDB Atlas Platform'
#### This project assumes that the database server is hosted in your local machine. 
Current settings are in <strong>'.env'</strong> file.
You can easily change this behaviour by changing the value of <strong>process.env.MONGO_URI</strong>


# How to run

* For the first time, you need run the following command
>npm run setup


You are ready to start your MERN project now.


* To start the development server
>npm run dev

* To start only nodejs server in development mode
>npm run server

* To start only client server
>npm run client

Thank You<br/>
